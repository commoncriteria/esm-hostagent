  <chapter title="Introduction" id="int">
    <section title="Overview" id="ppoverview"> The scope of this Extended Package is to
      describe the security functionality of a Host Agent in terms of <cite linkend="bibCC"/>
      and to define functional and assurance requirements for such products. This EP 
      is not complete in itself, but rather extends the Protection Profile for 
      Application Software <cite linkend="bibAppPP"/>. The combined requirements 
      in this Host Agent EP with the Application Software PP is met to be paired with an evaluation using 
      an Enterprise Security Management (ESM) Protection Profile. The ESM PP covers the security 
      functionality needed on the server or cloud service, and the paired Host Agent EP
      covers the security functionality needed on the endpoint device (desktop, mobile device, 
      etc.). At this time only the ESM <cite linkend="bibEDRPP"/> PP is published and ready for use with
      this Host Agent EP. Future
      versions of this Host Agent EP will include requirements for other classes of Enterprise Security 
      Management software.

      <subsection title="TOE Boundary" id="TOEboundary">
        The term Host Agent is the logical representation of all the software from the TOE
        vendor the represents the functionality of a Host Agent. The boundary for the Host Agent includes 
        all processes, all modules and libraries bundled with the Host Agent.  The Host 
        Agent can run as daemons or services on the platform but is not required too. The Host Agent is
        not expected to have a local or remote Graphical User Interface (GUI) for administration but having 
        such an interface is not precluded by this EP. It is expected that Host Agents will be managed by
        their associated ESM Server or the underlying platform. 
        The TOE boundary includes the communications channel with other Host Agents, an ESM server, or a cloud 
        service. The platform operating system or execution environment
        upon which the Host Agent is executing is outside the scope of a Host Agent evaluation. The figures
        below show some sample Host Agents but are not inclusive of every possible Host Agent design.

        the Host Agent software executes.

    <section title="Use Cases" id="usecases">Requirements in this Protection Profile are designed to
      address the security problems in at least the following use cases. These use cases are intentionally
      very broad, as many specific use cases exist for an operating system. These use cases may also
      overlap with one another.  An operating system's functionality may even be effectively extended by
      privileged applications installed onto it.  However, these are out of scope of this PP.

          <description>The Host Agent allows for communication interactively or
            non-interactively with other Enterprise Security Management (ESM) software over a communications channel.

            or commands.
