<!-- TODO/To consider items from tech editor:
1. EDR added an 'implicitly satisfied requirements' appendix to address missing dependency of FIA_UID.1. Unclear whether we should also add a 'blank' one here for layout consistency
or leave it blank because this Module is not missing any dependencies.

2. This Module has no assumptions but it's not possible so ideally the intro text for the Assumptions section (3.2) should not auto-populate 
(i.e. the same behavior that the OE objectives and OSPs sections have). That is not possible for the Assumptions section because it requires at least one set of <assumption></assumption> tags
to be present, which means it's impossible to define a null set of assumptions and trigger the null set intro text. Recommend updating schema to allow for this.

3. "Addressed by: " text added back in under the TOE objectives (mapped SFRs without rationale) at NIAP request. 
This used to be part of the schema with the <component-refer> tag but that is no longer supported.
Recommend updating the <addressed-by> tag to auto-populate the "Addressed by:" list under the objectives (so that the objective definition includes the mapping but the mapping table later on still
has the rationale).

4. Newer PPs are getting rid of the objective SFRs appendix and making it so that "strictly optional", "objective", and "implementation-dependent" SFRs are all sub-categories of optional SFRs.
This is done using the 'status' parameter in the f-component tag. However, this appears to only be supported for standalone PPs at the moment and not Modules.

5. The Module schema doesn't currently support mapping TOE objectives to arbitrary threats originally defined in a Base-PP. The O.PROTECTED_COMMS objective in this Module would most appropriately map
to the T.NETWORK_ATTACK and T.NETWORK_EAVESDROP threats from the App PP but there's currently no way to express that in a Module.

6. There is currently a glitch of some sort that is preventing the 'consistency of security problem definition' table from rendering. The TOE/OE objectives are also not displaying in their respective consistency
tables though the rationales do display correctly. This will need to be updated in the build script. Also note that the security problem definition technically includes all of threats/assumptions/OSPs
and so it is recommended that the intro text and associated table heading be updated accordingly (as well as any schema updates that would be needed to include assumptions and OSPs in the existing table).

  <section title="Introduction" id="int">
    <section title="Overview" id="ppoverview"> 
      The scope of this PP-Module is to describe the security functionality of a Host Agent in terms of [CC] 
      and to define functional and assurance requirements for such products. This PP-Module is intended for use with the following Base-PPs:
      
      <h:ul>
        <h:li>Protection Profile for Application Software Version 2.0</h:li>
      </h:ul>
      
      This Base-PP is valid because a Host Agent is deployed as a software application on a general-purpose operating system.

    <section title="Compliant Targets of Evaluation" id="TOEdescription">
      The requirements for the EDR are not covered in this PP-Module, however it is expected that an ESM system 
	    will evaluate against a PP-Configuration that includes both the <xref g="bibEDRPP"/> PP-Module  and the Host AgentPP-Module. 
	    The EDR PP-Module covers the security functionality needed on the server or cloud service, and the paired 
	    Host Agent PP-Module covers the security functionality needed on the endpoint device (desktop, mobile device, etc.). 
	    At this time only the <xref g="bibEDRPP"/> PP-Module is published and ready for use with this Host Agent PP-Module. 
	    Future versions of this PP-Module will include requirements for other classes of ESM software.
	    
      
      
      <section title="TOE Boundary" id="toeboundary">
        The boundary for the Host Agent includes 
        all processes, all modules, and libraries bundled with the Host Agent.  The Host 
        Agent can run as a daemon or service on the platform but is not required to. The Host Agent is
        not expected to have a local or remote Graphical User Interface (GUI) for administration but having 
        such an interface is not precluded by this PP-Module. It is expected that Host Agents will be managed by
        their associated ESM server or the underlying platform. 
        The TOE boundary includes the communications channel with other Host Agents, an ESM server, or a cloud 
        service. The platform operating system or execution environment
        upon which the Host Agent is executing is outside the scope of a Host Agent evaluation. The figures
        below show some sample Host Agents but are not inclusive of every possible Host Agent design.

        In a PP-Configuration that includes App PP, the TOE is expected to rely on some of the security functions implemented by the application 
        as a whole and evaluated against the Base-PP.
        The SFRs listed in this section are defined in the Base-PP and relevant to the secure operation of the Host Agent.
        This section describes any modifications that the ST author must make to the Base-PP SFRs to satisfy the required Host Agent functionality.

        If this PP-Module is used to extend the Application Software PP, the TOE type for the overall TOE is still a
        software-based application. The TOE boundary is simply extended to include the Host Agent functionality 
        that is built into the application so that additional security functionality is claimed within the scope of the TOE.
